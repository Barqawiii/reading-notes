# CREATING A BASIC JAVASCRIPT

#### JavaScript is written in plain text, just like HTML and CSS, so you do not need any new tools to write a script. This example adds a greeting into an HTML page
> 1. Create a folder to put the file , then start up your favorite code editor, and enter the text .
 A JavaScript file is just a text file (like HTML and CSS files are) but it has a .js file extension

 2.  Get the CSS and images 


 **When you want to use JavaScript with a web page, you use the HTML < script > element to tell the browser it is coming across a script.**

 > 3. In your code editor, enter the
HTML file .

  4.  Open the HTML file in your
browser
> 5. Once you have tried the example in your browser, view the source code for the page. 
6. The source of the web page does not actually show the new element that has been added into the page; it just shows the link to the JavaScript file. 
> 7.  Finally, try opening the HTML file, removing the src attribute from the opening < script > tag, and adding the new code shown on the left between the opening < script > tag and the closing < /script >tag. 
The src attribute is no longer needed because the JavaScript is in the HTML page
