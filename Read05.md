# Comparison Operators :
### Evaluating Condition :
(the result will be a boolean :true or false )


1. is equal to [==]

2. is not equal to [!=]
 
3. strict equal to [===]

4. strict not equal to [!==]

5. greater than [>]

6. less than [<]

7. greater than or qual to [>=]

8. less than or equal to [<=]

------------------------------------------------

### Logical Operators :
**&&** ,**II**,**!**

(logical operators allow you to compare the results of more than one comparison operators)

> (   (5<2)  &&  (2>=3)  )
      
>     F && F
>     F


### Short-Circuit Evaluation :
1. False && anything
> false 

2. True II anything
>true
--------------------------------------------
## Loops : 
**For**,**while**,**do while**
### 1. for loop :

for (initalization **;** condition **;** update on counter  ) {

    Statement to execute during loops
}

ex:

> var sum=0;
>
> for(var i=0;i<5>;i++){
> 
> sum = sum+i;
> 
> }

### 2. while loop :

initalization
while (condition){

    statement
    update on counter 
}
