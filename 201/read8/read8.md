  ### Screen Sizes
   >Different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show 
different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to 
work on a range of different sized screens.

  ### Screen Resolution

designers often try to create pages of around 960-1000 pixels wide

# Function 
  **WHAT IS A FUNCTION?**

  >Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a 
  specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can 
  reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).


   ```
   function updateMessage() { 
   var el = document.getElementByld('message'}; 
   el .textContent = msg; 
   } 
   updateMessage(};
   ```

   ## How does pair programming work?
   *pair programming commonly involves two roles:*
   1. the Driver 
   >the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code. 


   2. and the Navigator. 
   >The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer.(should not be writing any code.)

   ### Why pair program?

   **there are four fundamental skills that help anyone learn a new language:**
   
    1. Listening
    2. Speaking
    3. Reading
    4. Writing


   ## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming :
   1. Greater efficiency
   2. Engaged collaboration
   3. Learning from fellow students
   4. Social skills
   5. Job interview readiness
   6. Work environment readiness
