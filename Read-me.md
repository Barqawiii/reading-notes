# Git Tutorial

## Version Control
system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes
   
   ### 1. What is the Local Version Control ?
 *Entails one database on your hard disk that stores changes to files*
 
   ### 2. What is the Centralized  Version Control ?
 *This system entails a single server storing all changes and file versions, which can be accessed by various clients.*
 
   ### 3. What is the Distributed Version Control ?
 *DVCS allows clients to create mirrored repositories. These data backups can be easily be placed on the server to replace any lost information.*

 ## What is Git ??
 
   ### 1.Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots.
   ### 2.Git mostly relies on local operations.
   ### 3.Every single change applied to any file or directory is tracked by Git.
   ### 4.Git is set up to greatly minimize the possibility of irreversible damage to files, such as accidentally lost data.
   
   
   
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
 ## Files in Git can reside in three main states :
 **Committed** :Data is securely stored in a local database
 **Modified** :File has been changed but not committed to the database
 **Staged**:Flagged a fileâ€™s changed version to be committed in the next snapshot
