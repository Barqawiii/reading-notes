# Process & Design 
 * Every website should be designed for the target audience so you must understand who your target audience is.
 * You must know why people visit your website and what Information Your Visitors Need.
 * after you know what needs to appear on your site, you can start to organize the information into sections or pages. 
 * The aim is to create a diagram of the pages that will be used to structure the site. This is known as a site map and it will show how those pages can be grouped.

 * WireFrames: A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site. It shows the hierarchy of the information and how much space it might require.
